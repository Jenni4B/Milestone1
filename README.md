This is a video viewer. There are only two themes at the moment, but I'll add more in the future.

11/1/2024: Added local storage logic and profile information updates upon window load

The Future:

I'm going to change the videos and make this a hosting for my current interest: EPIC: The Musical by Jorge Rivera Herrans. I'm going to gather the most popular animatics and animations and sort them by artist, saga, and song. Maybe even a singer because I know some people might prefer different characters/singers (for example: Sort by Teagan Earley {voice actor}, Sort by Penelope {character}, sort by AnniFlamma {visual artist/animator})
